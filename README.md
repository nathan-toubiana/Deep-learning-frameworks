## About
Naive python implementations covering basic classification problems, multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) and a dimension reduction practice.

### 1-basic_classifiers 
Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Softmax classifier.

### 2-mlp

multi-layer-perceptron (MLP)

###  3-dim_reduction
